# jira_ticket_assistant

Hello! This repo is an experiment of mine where I use OpenAI, LangChain and SQLAlchemy to generate user stories and test data based on business stakeholder input received via a chatbot. 
The output is a cohesive, actionable ticket with live-tested and validated testing scripts.

The code is currently demonstrated piece by piece in Jupyter notebook format instead of an app shell.

Please note that to run this locally, you will need..
1. ..an OpenAI API key environment variable.
2. ..an accessible Azure SQL Database.
